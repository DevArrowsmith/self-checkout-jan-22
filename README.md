## Using this Readme

## Introduction

In this exercise we're using test-driven development to create a **self-checkout application** that meets the following user requirements:

1. As a user, I would like to be able to scan an item using barcode so its details can be found from products list (test data).

2. As a user, I would like to be able to add an item to my basket.

3. As a user, I would like to be able to see the total price of all items in my basket.

4. As a user, I would like to be able to remove an item from my basket. 

The project requirements can also be found in [this google Sheets doc](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vvQdusuqxV8D0LQ2ZqRvOEoDRN7HD3hdjsPFpDpMb6E/edit#slide=id.p).
So far requirements 1 and 2 have been met. Requirements 3 and 4 have yet to be fulfilled.

## Next Steps

- Fork this repo, then try to complete this exercise by fulfilling the final two user requirements.
- Use **Test Driven Development (TDD)**.
- Use the <span style="color: coral">**Red**</span>, <span style="color: aquamarine">**Green**</span>, <span style="color: goldenrod">**Refactor**</span> process:
  - <span style="color: coral">**Red:**</span> Write a test for the functionality that you want. Initially this will fail.
  - <span style="color: aquamarine">**Green:**</span> Write the code required to pass the test and fulfil the user requirement.
  - <span style="color: goldenrod">**Refactor:**</span> See if you can imporve your solution. Think about ways to make it efficient and readable.
  - Repeat for each user requirement.

## Extra Credit (optional!)
- Once you've completed the exercise why not take a look at other groups' solutions?
  - [Jenny's Group Solution](https://github.com/jennyardrey/selfCheckoutJan22)
- You could also think about ways to structure the project differently
  - Could the test data be stored in a separate file from the functions? 
  - Rather than having separate variable for each fruit and the catalogue, could the data be stored in a single data structure? How would the application use this data?
- Feel free to update this readme!
